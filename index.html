    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p>These terms and conditions apply to the Chlora app (hereby referred to as "Application") for Discord that was created by Fento (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service.</p>
    <p>Upon utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application. Unauthorized copying or modification of the Application or any part of the Application is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All applicable trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>
    <p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.</p>
    <p>The Application temporarily stores message content that is provided to the Service when running commands such as Scattergories and immediately deletes it after. User IDs and Customized Usernames are stored in order to provide the Service, as well as user statistics in the game commands. If the user wishes to not have any of this information stored, they may choose to do so by not utilizing the bot. Customized nicknames that the user has added for themselves can be removed via the "removename" command. No other user information is stored.</p>
    <p>Functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.</p>
    <p>In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the application.</p>
    <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the application at any point. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application.</p>
    <p>These terms and conditions are effective as of 2024-03-18</p>
